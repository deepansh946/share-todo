## Setting up the Project

- Fork the repo and clone it to your local machine.
- For the project to work you have to setup a firebase project.
  Create a Project from the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

- Enable firestore in your project and firebase auth (google and sign-in password) in your firebase console.
- Once that is done, duplicate the .env.example file and rename it to just .env. Grab the keys from firebase console and paste it in the .env file.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the project. More details are available in the guide section.

## ðŸ‘‰ Get Started

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Create a file `.env`, copy the contents from `.env.example`.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

You would have to enable firestore, firebase google auth and create a service account and copy the values to the `.env` file.
